Problem Statement:
Generate synthetic Bitcoin data, validate anomalies such as missing or duplicate records, and train regression models to predict closing prices. The objective is to demonstrate predictive modeling with financial time-series data.
Project Workflow:
 
Step No  	Project Step		Description		                                                Machine Learning Models Used
1	        Data Generation		Create or use synthetic cryptocurrency data for	analysis.		
2	        Data  Cleaning 	&			records to ensure data quality.		  
            Handle  missing,  
            null,  duplicate,  
            and  outlier 
            Validation

3	        Feature Engineering	Compute  derived  metrics  such  as  moving	averages,  log 
                                 returns,  and  volume  ratios  for		improved modeling.		

4	        Model Application	Train  and  apply  regression  models  for	                    	Linear  Regression,  Random
			                    predictive analysis of price trends.                                Forest  Regressor,  XGBoost Regressor

5	        Fine-Tuning		    Optimize  hyperparameters  using GridSearchCV  or                   Linear  Regression,  Random
                                RandomizedSearchCV  to	enhance model accuracy.	                    Forest  Regressor,  XGBoost Regressor
6	        Reporting 	&      	Generate  evaluation  metrics  (R†,  RMSE,		
	        Visualization   	Matplotlib, Seaborn MAPE) and performance plots using 
                                Matplotlib	and Seaborn.
